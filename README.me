# DARAJA API
Safaricom Daraja API is a mobile payment platform that allows businesses to integrate M-Pesa payments into their applications. To implement Daraja API in PHP, you will need to follow these steps:

**steps**

1. Set up a developer account with Safaricom and create an app on the Daraja platform.
2. Install the Daraja PHP SDK, which provides an easy-to-use interface for making API requests.
3. Use the SDK to generate an access token, which you will need to authenticate your API requests.
4. Use the SDK to make API requests to perform various M-Pesa operations, such as initiating a payment, checking payment status, and querying account balances.
